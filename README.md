Studentbiz is a windows application created to assist students in calculating their participation marks. 
It calculates the final participation mark based on the students quiz, practical, mid-semester and attendance marks.

    1. Quiz = All the quizzes are added into an array and then summed up to give a total mark out of 45 for the quizes
    2. Practical = The practical mark recieved from the user is stored as an integer out of 150
    3. Mid-semester (Mid) = The mid-semester mark is stored as an integer out out 75
    4. Attendance = The attendance mark out of 28 received from the user is multiplied by 30 because attendance counts 30% towards participation mark
    5. The total participation is then calculated out of 300
    6. The final percentage of the learners mark is then calculated and the grading is determined using a sequence of if-else decision statements. 
    7. A sentence stated the students name, student number, mark, the urrent semester provided and grading is then displayed to the user.
